# Memory-game

## A gist 
This is a classic game that tests the player's concentration and memory retention abilities. We've all played this at some point in our lives. For those of you folks who haven't played this before or who have forgotten the rules, here's a quick recap: 

> The player gets to turn over 2 cards at a time. If the pictures on the cards' faces match then the cards will remain turned over. If they do not match, the cards are turned face down again and the player goes over the entire deck upturning 2 cards at a time and trying to remember where they had seen the card before. The clock's ticking so keep an eye on the timer while you work those brain muscles.
